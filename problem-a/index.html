      Sebastian in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_La_Land">La La Land</a> is a passionate jazz musician, characterized by his dedication to traditional jazz and his dream of opening his own club. He's often seen wearing a classic wardrobe, typically consisting of tailored suits and dress shirts, reflecting a style that pays homage to jazz greats of the past. Sebastian is idealistic, somewhat stubborn, yet deeply charismatic, with a strong belief in the power and significance of jazz music.
